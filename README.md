# > SkroutzPseudoAPI
A PseudoAPI created for retrieving data from popular greek store portal skroutz.gr
# > Why does this PseudoAPI exist?
Welp, the skroutz.gr development team (for good or for bad) has disabled their api endpoint from receiving requests for quite some time now. This has limited the creativity of aspiring developers. So I've built this "PseudoAPI" that retrieves data like an actual api.
# > Usage
Download the main.py file and import it on your python files that the api request would usually be executed on. Do not import this on any file that just uses the api's data as this is useless and may cause import loops.
There is a demo on the app.py file on how to parameterise the api call.

# > Why Python?
Believe it or not, scraping is the hardest part of creating a PseudoAPI. It's harder than handling the data. So this PseudoAPI should be used to retrieve and store the data.<br><br>
All of the operations on the data should be then handled by your programming language of choice. And yes, if your backend operates on python, then you could use this PseudoAPI directly.

# > What type of Data does this PseudoAPI currently retrieve?
As of now, this PseudoAPI only retrieves data for products and can be parameterised as such. <br><br>Check the #flags section on the repository's wiki for more info about the entities retrieved and their data types.
